**⚠️⚠️⚠️ Alert ⚠️⚠️⚠️**

I created a similar project [visitor-badge](https://github.com/jwenjian/visitor-badge) and hosted on the [glitch.com](https://glitch.com) to avoid the free hours limitation in heroku.

~~So I will archive this project and migrate the current data to new project one by one.~~

Migration is done!!!

Please switch to new project and **use the same repo_id value as page_id parameter**, I will migrate the current data one by one. After that, I may **stop** deploy this project to heroku.

Sorry for the inconvience and hope you have a better experience with the new project.

Any question please [open a new issue](https://github.com/jwenjian/visitor-badge/issues/new) on new project.
